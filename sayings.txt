on a cold day in hell
in a cuckoo summer
when the sun would rise from the West
when grapes ripen on the willow
when there's two thursdays in a week
when easter and whitsun fall on the same day
when chicken have teeth
on saint never's day
when it's snowing red snowflakes
when geese piss
when the owl's tail blossoms
when the crow flies upside down
when the pig climbs the pear tree in yellow slippers
when the crawfish whistles on the mountain
when frogs grow hair
when st john lowers a finger
when the louse sneezes
maybe in the year two-thousand-and-never
when the 7-eleven closes
